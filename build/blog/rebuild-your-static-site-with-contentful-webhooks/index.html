    <h2 class="capitalize">Rebuild your static site automatically with Contentful web hooks and Netlify</h2>
    <p>I finally got <a href="https://api.netlify.com/build_hooks/5da887040cdf95770ff25e4f">Contentful</a> to work. It took a bit of tweaking here and there,  as I am still new to React and GraphQL, I got there in the end though.</p>
<p>I was clicking through my site, making sure all the posts were working as intended. I had to re-publish a post as I was having issues with images in markdown files. But my site never started a build phase within Netlfiy after I re-published the post. Whaaaaaat?!!. Why wasn't this working?</p>
<p>After some Googling, it seemed I needed something called a webhook. I have seen the word webhook mentioned many times, but was never too sure what they did. So I also googled that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A webhook in web development is a method of augmenting or altering the behavior of a web page, or web application, with custom callbacks. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Makes sense.  How could I get a webook to build my site in Netlify once I published or un-published a blog post? Luckily Contentful has some good docs...</p>
<h3>Update your environment variables within Netlify</h3>

<p>For more information on how to configure a static site for continuous deployment, refer to the guide on the <a href="https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/">Netlify documentation</a>.</p>
<h3>Configuring a Netlify build hook</h3>
<p><img alt="netlify-build-hooks.601518971e" src="//images.ctfassets.net/53u3hzg2egeu/1RTHi69ot1LlOvmd2CChus/a7915e09d7e328c751aadc14792b1d2a/netlify-build-hooks.601518971e.png"></p>
<p>It's as simple as clicking <strong>Add build hook</strong>, giving it a memorable name, and choosing the branch you'd like to build. Netlify will then do some magic and create a HTTPS URL, which will then respond to a <code>POST</code> request by trigging your build and deploying it when you publish or unpublish new content.</p>
<p>Copy the url, which will look something like this: <code>https://api.netlify.com/build_hooks/&lt;someString&gt;</code> and then use Contentfuls <a href="https://app.contentful.com/deeplink?link=webhook-template&amp;id=netlify-deploy-site">Netlify webhook template</a> to configure the webook quickly. </p>

<p>Easy as that...this post was created in Contentful, which trigged my webhook, which built and deployed my site with this new post. </p>
