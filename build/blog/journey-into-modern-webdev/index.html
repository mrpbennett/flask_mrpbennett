    <h2 class="capitalize">A new journey into modern webdev</h2>
    <p>I am typing this currently unemployed. COVID-19 hasn't been the kindest of things for me and my partner, it's turned our life kinda upside down. Things are getting better but the job market sucks right now.</p>
<p>Therefore I am going back to basics to solidify my skill set. Web development for me is currently only a hobby, this site shows that. I want to make it a full-time career though, at 35 I have it in my head that it's going to be hard. I suffer from imposter syndrome a lot and feel I currently don't have what it takes to become a junior frontend dev.</p>
<p>So from today (Thursday 18th June), I am going to take myself on a journey through Udemy, and going through JS, React, Node and GraphQL. I built this site using a Youtube tutorial by <a href="https://twitter.com/andrew_j_mead" title="tutor">Andrew Mead</a> on Gatsby who I found to be a great teacher, I am going through his courses which are:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript/" title="modern js">The Modern JavaScript Bootcamp</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/react-2nd-edition/" title="react course">The Complete React Developer Course (w/ Hooks and Redux)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/" title="node js">The Complete Node.js Developer Course (3rd Edition)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/graphql-bootcamp/" title="graphql">The Modern GraphQL Bootcamp (with Node.js and Apollo) </a> </li>
</ol>
<p>During these courses, I will continue to keep my <a href="https://github.com/mrpbennett/TIL" title="til repo">TIL repo</a> updated with new learnings. I will also more than likely write some posts on my experiences also.</p>
<p>I hope by the time I have finished these courses, I will have the skillset to become a web developer. </p>
<p>Watch this space.</p>
