        <h2>About me 👨🏼‍💻</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a solutions engineer based in London, UK. Before solution
          engineering, I spent my time in account management within Ad Tech.

        <h3>A brief overview of my tech journey</h3>
        <p>
          I have come to the developer world late, although I have always
          dabbled since my teens. I have never "seriously" learnt to code until
          2019. Where I restarted to learn Python which will always be my first
          love, then on to things like React and Vue. Now though it's time to
          really dig into Python, I deal with a lot of data in my day to day,
          that's why I've switched my focus primarily to Python and SQL.
        </p>
        <p>
          As far as next steps, I'm still figuring out what I want to do and
          where I want to be. So stay tuned because I'll definitely be sharing
          more about what the future holds.
        </p>
